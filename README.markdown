# Pretty Github Gist RSS Feed Maker.
*****
I wrote this app so I could have nice GitHub gist support in my
Google Reader feeds.

###Running at: http://gistrss.appspot.com/
*****
###Future Plans
	- Include Pygments lib to convert the gists to pretty syntax
	highlighted images.
	- If anyone starts using it, lots of optimization and caching
